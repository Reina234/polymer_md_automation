1. need to test full run, check that it works with compressibliity mods

2. deal with automatic getting of compressiblity and temperature from the file name 

3. add in prod run 

4. check course running 

5. need to trial compressibility and test mods work 

6. need to change Solvent data model !

7. make function to extract the compressibility and temp from file names, same w the polymer name
   should be automated so that I just need to pass in the polymer and 
   solvent name


   rip, need to add in genion part, minim first, grommp, then genion
   then temperature coupling needs fixing too

   pycgtool for CG mapping in post, and then full prod run

   will need to add in ions.itp into topol

   Need to make sure that the course graining mapping files properly outputs things like 1:TMZK:C1,
   instead of just the indices

   Also, make a strategy class that rdkit takes in, which does the add to mapping stuff


csg_map --top temp/nvt_short.tpr --trj temp/nvt_short.trr --out CG-traj.xtc --cg "rdkit_test2.xml;solvent.xml"
seems to have worked!!!
